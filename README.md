# DNS-server-example
implementing a server that gets URL addresses from clients and returns them back their ip numbers.
if the server has the specific ip address of the given URL (saving in a file) - the server immediately returns back the ip address 
and if the server hasn't have the ip address , the server will ask his parent server for the ip and so on (recursively).
